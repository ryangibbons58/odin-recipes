This is the first project I'm doing for The Odin Project course.

I will be using my new HTML skills to create a basic recipe website.

I've so far created a new GitHub Repo called "odin-recipes" and cloned it to my local machine.

Next I'll be creating an index.html page, then 3 recipe pages. All recipe pages will have links to them from my index page.

My index page will have an H1 Heading of "Recipes", followed by 3 links.

Each recipe page will contain an H1 heading with the recipe name, followed by an image of the finished recipe.

Under the image will be an H2 Heading "Description" followed by a 1-2 paragraph of the recipe/dish.

Next, an "Ingrediants" Heading and an UNORDERED list of the ingrediants.

Finally, there will be a "Steps" Heading followed by an ORDERED list of the steps required to make the dish. 


This will require me to use my understanding of the terminal and creation of the HTML boilerplate for each webpage. I will need to use appropriately sized Headings, paragraph tags, image links, and lists (ordered and unordered). 

Finally, I will need to practice committing changes to Github and adding commit messages.

I am making a change to the README file now, because I'd like to go throught the whole add/commit process, this time remembering to add a commit message (either using -m or not)
